        <h1>NETO</h1>
        <p>1989 - 1993</p>
        <p>
          Neto, whose full name is José Ferreira Neto, is one of the most iconic
          players in the history of Corinthians. Playing as a midfielder, Neto
          became known for his refined technique, precise free kicks, and strong
          personality on the field. His most memorable spell at the club was
          between 1989 and 1993, when he became a fan favorite. The highlight of
          his time at Corinthians was winning the 1990 Brazilian Championship,
          the first national title in the club’s history. Neto played a key role
          in that achievement, delivering crucial performances and scoring
          important goals, especially in the knockout rounds. Despite some
          controversies during his career, his charisma and passion for
          Corinthians earned him a special place in the hearts of the fans.
          After retiring, Neto became a sports commentator, always staying
          connected to football and to the club that made him a legend.

          That iconic free-kick photo of Neto against Bahia was taken on October
          6, 1990, during the first leg of the Brazilian Championship semifinal.
          The match was at Pacaembu Stadium, and Corinthians won 2–1. Neto
          scored the winning goal with a banger of a free kick from outside the
          box at around the 18th minute of the second half. That goal gave
          Corinthians the edge going into the second leg. The second match ended
          in a 0–0 draw, and Corinthians moved on to the final — eventually
          winning their first ever national title. That photo of Neto right as
          he hits the ball? It's legendary. It became one of the most memorable
          images in the club’s history and still gives fans goosebumps to this
          day.

        <h1>SOCRATES</h1>
        <p>1978 - 1984 </p>
        <p>
          On and off the field, Sócrates was a true legend. Known as “The
          Doctor” — not just for his elegance on the ball, but also because he
          was a trained physician — Sócrates was the brain of Corinthians’
          midfield and a symbol of intelligence, class, and leadership. He
          played a key role in helping Corinthians win the 1979 Paulista title
          and the 1982/83 back-to-back championships. More than just a
          footballer, Sócrates became the face of Democracia Corinthiana, a
          revolutionary movement where everyone at the club — from the president
          to the kit man — had an equal voice in decisions. Through it, he
          taught fans and the country about democracy and collective power.
          Sócrates was famous for his backheel passes, his calm and cerebral
          style of play, and his signature goal celebration — simply raising a
          clenched right fist in the air. Despite not living like a traditional
          athlete — drinking, smoking, and often calling himself "just a regular
          guy" — he became one of the most beloved figures in Corinthians
          history, exactly because he was human, flawed, and authentic. He also
          played in Europe, other Brazilian clubs, and represented Brazil in two
          World Cups: 1982 and 1986. To this day, Sócrates is remembered not
          just as one of Corinthians’ greatest players, but as a symbol of
          football with soul and purpose.

          Amid Brazil's military dictatorship, Corinthians experienced a unique
          period known as "Corinthians Democracy." This movement, which lasted
          from 1982 to 1984, was led by renowned players such as Sócrates,
          Wladimir, Casagrande, Biro-Biro, Zé Maria, and Zenon.​ Meu Timão +1
          Meu Timão +1 During this time, the club adopted a democratic
          management model where players, coaching staff, and employees had
          equal say in decisions. Matters like training schedules, player
          signings, and other club operations were decided collectively, with
          each member's vote carrying the same weight.​ This approach was
          revolutionary in Brazilian football, especially during a period of
          authoritarian rule in the country. The movement not only brought
          success on the field, with Corinthians winning the São Paulo State
          Championship in 1982 and 1983, but also became a symbol of political
          resistance and a push for democratic values in society.​ The unity
          among players and staff was the cornerstone of Corinthians Democracy,
          leaving a lasting legacy in both sports and Brazilian history.
