        <h1>A Team of the People, Built to Challenge the Elite</h1>
        <p>
          On September 1, 1910, five working-class men from Bom Retiro, a
          neighborhood in São Paulo, came together with a dream: to create a
          soccer team for the people. Back then, soccer in Brazil was a sport
          for the rich, played mostly by European immigrants and the elite. But
          these workers wanted in. They didn’t just want to watch from the
          sidelines—they wanted to play, to compete, to be a part of the game.
          Inspired by the Corinthian Football Club from England, they founded
          their own club, but with a different mission. This wasn't just about
          soccer. It was about giving a voice to the working class, about
          proving that the sport wasn’t just for the wealthy—it was for
          everyone. Under the light of a single lamp, they made it official:
          Corinthians was born to challenge the system. And the people embraced
          it. While other clubs catered to the elite, Corinthians became the
          team of the streets, the workers, the underdogs. It was more than just
          a club; it was a movement. Fans saw themselves in the team—fighting
          against the odds, pushing forward with heart and passion. It wasn’t
          easy, but Corinthians never backed down. Over time, the club grew,
          winning games, titles, and, most importantly, the love of its people.
          Today, Corinthians is one of the biggest and most successful teams in
          Brazil. But at its core, it remains the same: a team born from the
          people, for the people—a club that represents the fight, the struggle,
          and the never-ending passion of its fans.
